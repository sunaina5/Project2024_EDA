# Project2024_EDA
Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) utilizing anomaly-driven methodologies to uncover hidden insights and patterns within the dataset.

Effectively handled missing values through strategic imputation techniques, ensuring minimal data loss and maintaining data integrity throughout the analysis process.

Identified and treated outliers using robust statistical methods, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of subsequent analysis results.

Implemented advanced feature encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding to transform categorical variables into a suitable format for predictive modeling.

Executed feature scaling procedures such as standardization and normalization to mitigate the impact of varying scales and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Implemented rigorous data cleaning procedures, including data deduplication, normalization, and data type conversions, to ensure the dataset's cleanliness and consistency.

Addressed complex data analysis queries through systematic exploration, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling, providing actionable insights to stakeholders.

Employed advanced visualization techniques, including heatmaps, box plots, and scatter plots, to effectively communicate findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Collaborated with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements, align analysis goals, and deliver actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights.

Documented methodologies, findings, and recommendations in clear and concise reports, enabling stakeholders to understand and leverage the outcomes of the analysis effectively.
